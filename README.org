Interpreter / compiler for the Monkey programming language.

This repo is for tracking my progress according to [[https://interpreterbook.com/][Writing An Interpreter In Go]]
and [[https://compilerbook.com/][Writing A Compiler In Go]].

Unlike those books, however, this implementation will be written in Rust
because... I prefer Rust. And I like a challenge.

This is a personal project.
